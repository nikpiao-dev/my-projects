# Sockets Notes

Sockets - can be used to connect two nodes together.
    # are a fundamental networking concept used for 
    # communication between computers in a network.

    # socket object
        # - socket.socket() function, 
            # takes two parameters(address family and socket type)

    # address family:
     # (socket.AF_INET for IPv4)

    # socket type:
     # (e.g., socket.SOCK_STREAM for TCP)
     # or (socket.SOCK_DGRAM for UDP)


- example: 

    """ 
        # import socket

        # Create a TCP socket
        tcp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)


        # Create a UDP socket
        udp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

    """

   # - Socket Communication:

        # Once you have a socket object, you can use various methods to establish connections, send data, and receive data. Here are some commonly used methods:
    """
            # socket.connect(address): Establishes a connection to a remote address.

            # socket.bind(address): Binds the socket to a specific address and port.

            # socket.listen(backlog): Listens for incoming connections on a TCP socket.

            # socket.accept(): Accepts an incoming connection and returns a new socket object for communication.

            # socket.send(data): Sends data over the socket.

            # socket.recv(buffer_size): Receives data from the socket.
    """


# - Here's an example of a basic TCP server that listens for incoming connections:

"""
import socket


# Create a TCP socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)


# Bind the socket to a specific address and port
server_address = ('localhost', 1234)
server_socket.bind(server_address)


# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)


while True:
    # Accept a client connection
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()


    # Receive and send data
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    client_socket.send(b"Received: " + data)


    # Close the client socket
    client_socket.close()

"""




# - Socket Programming:

import socket

HOST = "127.0.0.1"
PORT = "7777"

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INETm socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
    # af_inet is ipv4, sock_stream is a port

s.connect((HOST, PORT))


# use "netcat or nc" to open port
