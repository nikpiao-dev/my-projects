#  React: Checkpoint Project - Color Picker 🎨


[Color Picker](./colorPicker.png)

## Checkpoint ⛳️

I’ve made it through the first four chapters of React, and now it’s time to put what I’ve learned into action by building a Color Picker app!

For this project, I’m going to create a simple color picker where users can click on a color and see its name or hex code. I’ll use state to keep track of the selected color and set up a few event handlers for things like clicking and hovering.

It’s a fun way to practice all the React basics I’ve learned so far, like JSX, components, and events. Can’t wait to see it all come together!

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

To get started, I need:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **Vite** (for creating the React app)
- **Visual Studio Code** (or my preferred code editor)

### Steps to Start

1. I’ll create a new React project using Vite:

   ```bash
   
   - Setup React App:
   
   npm create vite@latest
   project name: color-picker
   select a framework: React
   select a variant: Javascript

   - Run react app:
   
   cd color-picker
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
