# Recap
Woohoo! You made it to the end of the chapter!

To recap, here's everything we've learned about CRUD:

GET is how we read data from the server.
See a list of people who liked your post 🩷
POST is for sending data to the server.
Publish a post to the grid 📰
PUT fully replaces existing data with new data.
Replace the entire caption of your post ✍️
PATCH makes partial updates to data.
Fix a typo on part of your post 🔧
DELETE removes something from the server.
Remove your post 🗑️
cURL is the tool we use to send requests (like POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to the server from the terminal.
These HTTP methods are the building blocks for working with data in web applications.

Whether you're getting, sending, changing, or deleting data, they help you communicate with servers and build interactive apps.

Let's use what we learned to build a custom app!
