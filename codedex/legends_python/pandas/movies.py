Instructions
In the notebook on the right, we've imported pandas and created a DataFrame named movies!

Now, type the following into the input box at the bottom of the page:

movies

And press shift + enter to run the code. A table should appear.

Boom. We're now ready to learn how to use Pandas to answer questions about this data. ðŸ™Œ

Bonus: Now letâ€™s get curious. Whatâ€™s a question you might ask about this dataset?

Write it as a Python comment and hit shift + enter again. For example:

# What month is the best month to release a movie? What month is the worst?
# Which film studio has the highest average profit?
