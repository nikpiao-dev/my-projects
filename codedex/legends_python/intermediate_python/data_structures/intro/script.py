# Instructions:

# First, a quick refresh on lists. 📋

# In a world where social media usage makes up 2+ hours of our day on average, it's hard to keep up with slang. Let's build a list of your favorite trendy or overused expressions! 😎

# For example:

# genz_slang = ['bestie', 'tea', 'cap', 'sus']

# Then, go ahead and print out your list!


genz_slang = ['bestie', 'tea', 'cap', 'sus']
print(genz_slang)
