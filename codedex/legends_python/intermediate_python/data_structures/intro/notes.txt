Hi Bestie!
# Intro
Welcome back! Guess who’s back? Back again? It's Python! 🐍

It's time to take things to another level with Python, it's finally time to add data structures to your toolkit.



From creating whimsical Nyan Cat GIFs 🌈 to powering machine learning algorithms 🤖 , Python's extensive libraries and data structures make it a powerful language for data handling and data collection. Get ready to unleash your creativity!

# Back to Basics
Understanding data types is critical to organize and manipulate information in Python.

Let's go over our fundamental data types:

🔢 int: Whole numbers like 0, 1, -4, 200.
🎈 float: Decimals numbers like 3.14, 0.0, 12.99.
🧵 str: Sequences of characters, enclosed in quotes like "howdy!"
✅ bool: Boolean representations of a True or False value.
Data structures are containers that let us organize and store data effectively.

Remember Python lists? Those were data structures! A list stores different types of items in order, simplifying data organization and manipulation.

social_platforms = ['TikTok', 'Instagram', 'BeReal']

In this chapter, we will focus on three new data structures:

Tuples
Dictionaries
Sets
Each data structure comes with their own strengths and choosing the "right" one can significantly improve your program. 💪
