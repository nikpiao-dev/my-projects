In this chapter, we learned the following:

int, float, str, and bool types.
Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences.
Dictionaries are unordered sequences of key-value pairs.
Sets are unordered lists of unique items.
For a refresher, here are what these data structures look like:

# Tuple
teams = ('TeamA', 'TeamB')

# Dictionary
basketball_player = {'name': 'LeBron James', 'team': 'Los Angeles Lakers'}

# Set
soccer_positions = {'Forward', 'Midfielder', 'Defender', 'Goalkeeper'}
