Instructions
Mental math can bring up mixed feelings. A core math concept is that even numbers are integers divisible by 2.

Let’s practice using list comprehensions to create a list of even numbers from the following list of integers:

numbers = [57, 10, 82, 36, 89, 46, 13, 23, 92, 48]

Create a list comprehension that filters the even numbers.
Print the original range and the list of even numbers.
Your outcome should look like this:

Original Numbers: [57, 10, 82, 36, 89, 46, 13, 23, 92, 48]
Even Numbers: [10, 82, 36, 46, 92, 48]

Bonus: create and print a list of odd numbers

"""



numbers = [57, 10, 82, 36, 89, 46, 13, 23, 92, 48]

even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
odd_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]


print("Original Numbers:", numbers)
print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Odd Numbers:", odd_numbers)
