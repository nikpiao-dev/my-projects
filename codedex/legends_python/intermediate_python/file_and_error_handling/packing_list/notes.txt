10. Packing List
# Congrats!
Nice work on getting to the end of the chapter! ðŸ”¥

Letâ€™s recap what we learned:

File handling in Python, including how to read and write files.
Using the the .read() , .write(), and .seek() methods to interact with file contents.
Working with CSV file data using the csv module.
As a refresher, here is what file handling in Python looks like:

with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
  try:
    # Work with files here
  except Error:
    # Catch errors here
