# CSV Files
I donâ€™t think you can handle this. ðŸ”¥

CSVs... youâ€™ve seen them, youâ€™ve used them, maybe it's complicated between you both. ðŸ‘€

A CSV (comma-separated values) file is a common format for organizing data. Python provides a nifty csv module to read and write data in this format.

Each row in a CSV file typically represents a record, and the values within a record are separated by commas. This simple structure makes CSV a widely used format for storing and exchanging data between applications.

# Reading CSV Files
Letâ€™s hit the books. ðŸ“š

From the csv module, we use the .reader() method to create a CSV reader object that displays our file content, row by row:

import csv

# Open the CSV file in 'read' mode with UTF-8 encoding
with open('example.csv', 'r', encoding='utf8') as file:
  # Create a CSV reader object
  csv_reader = csv.reader(file)

  for row in csv_reader:
    print(row)


Sometimes opening CSV files without specifying an encoding can cause decoding errors (especially in IDEs). If you're seeing strange errors when reading the file, try adding encoding="utf8" when opening the file. It helps Python properly read characters from the file.

The .reader() method returns a list of rows where each row is a list of CSV data.

With a for loop, you can iterate through each row in the reader object.

# Writing to CSV Files
Writing to a CSV file is simple.

We use the .writer() method to create a CSV writer object, and then use its methods to write rows to the file.

import csv

# Data to be written to the CSV file
data_to_write = [
  ['Name', 'Age', 'Grade'],
  ['Alice', 25, 'A'],
  ['Bob', 22, 'B'],
  ['Charlie', 28, 'A+']
]

# Open the CSV file in 'write' mode
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
  # Create a CSV writer object
  csv_writer = csv.writer(file)

  # Write the data to the CSV file
  csv_writer.writerows(data_to_write)

The writer object's .writerows() method can parse something iterable (like a list of lists!) and write it into the CSV file. In this example there is a newline parameter that ensures the results are printed on a new line.
