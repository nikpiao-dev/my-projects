Dear Diary
# File Handling
In data analysis, we can use Python to work with other files!

File input/output (I/O) handling lets us interact with external files for various purposes, including:

✏️ Saving information to a file by writing to it.
🔍 Reading from a file to use its information.
🔧 Maintaining your computer's file system.
We will dive into the practical aspects of file handling, including common operations, and handling different formats like CSV. 🧑‍💻

# Files in Python
Note: Throughout this chapter, you will need a separate code editor like VS Code to run these examples.

The open() method is your gateway to handling files in Python!

# This opens example file for writing
file = open('example.txt', 'w')

In this example, you specify the filename and how you want to handle it (e.g., reading or writing). The open() method can create a file or open a file depending on the conditions.

We can write to this example file object with the .write() method:

file.write('Hello, World! 🌎')

If you run the code above, a new example.txt file with the text is created on your computer!

Instructions
Diaries can contain anything and everything. Some have even won awards. 🤫 Regardless of what your writing aspirations may be, let’s make a diary. Your secret is safe with us (your local storage 🔐).

Let’s start writing!

Use the open() method to create a new diaries.txt file.
Fill your new diary with entries or secrets. 🤐
Each entry should be separated by a new line.
