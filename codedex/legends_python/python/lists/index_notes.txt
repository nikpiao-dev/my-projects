23. To-Do List
# Index
List items are changeable, meaning we can update individual items within a list.

But before we do that, how can we access an individual item within a list? Well, this is where index comes in!

An index is an item's position in a list.

Python is 0-indexed, meaning that the indices starts at 0:

vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
# Index:   0    1    2    3    4

The item at index 0 is 'a'.
The item at index 1 is 'e'.
The item at index 2 is 'i'.
The item at index 3 is 'o'.
The item at index 4 is 'u'.
To output each of the items, we can use the name[index] syntax:

print(vowels[0])     # Output: a
print(vowels[1])     # Output: e
print(vowels[2])     # Output: i
print(vowels[3])     # Output: o
print(vowels[4])     # Output: u

# Negative Index
Another thing to note about index is that it can be positive or negative.

If the index is negative, it starts from -1 (which is the last item of a list) and it goes backwards from there.

vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
# Index:   0    1    2    3    4
# Index:  -5   -4   -3   -2   -1

The item at index -5 is 'a'.
The item at index -4 is 'e'.
The item at index -3 is 'i'.
The item at index -2 is 'o'.
The item at index -1 is 'u'.
# Slicing
Is there a way to get more than just one individual item? Yep! It's called slicing.

Slicing is where we can access certain parts of a sequence.

Instead of accessing an item using a single index like name[index], we can get multiple items by specifying where to start and where to end the range like name[start : end].

For example:

vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

print(vowels[0 : 3])
print(vowels[1 : 3])

# Output:
# ['a', 'e', 'i']
# ['e', 'i']

It starts from the start index (inclusive) and ends before the end index (non-inclusive). So in the above example, print(vowels[1 : 3]) only returned items at indices 1 and 2, and didn't include index 3.

# IndexError
There is a common error in Python when dealing with sequences called the IndexError. This is what happens when the index is out of the range of a list.

For example, when we try to do vowels[5], we will get something like:

Traceback (most recent call last):
    print(vowels[5])
IndexError: list index out of range

So make sure to be careful with that!
