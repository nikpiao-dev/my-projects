Back in the good ol' days, a mixtape is a compilation of music, a playlist, recorded onto a cassette tape or a CD.

Create a mixtape.py program and think of a theme for the songs.

Make a list called playlist and throw in some songs.

For example:

# ðŸ’¿ Theme: Indie Travel Songs

playlist = [
  'Porches - rangerover',
  'Mount Eerie - You Swan, Go On',
  'Carolyn Polachek - Look at Me Now',
  'Pinegrove - Darkness',
  'LVL UP - Spirit Was',
  'Mitski - First Love / Late Spring'
]

Now loop over the list and print everything out! ðŸ“»
