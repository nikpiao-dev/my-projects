27. Bucket List
# Congrats!
You just added a super helpful tool to your coding toolbox: lists!

Here's a recap of the chapter:

Lists are used to store different items in a single variable.
An index is an item's position in a list. Python lists are 0-indexed.
Slicing can access certain parts of a list with name[start:end].
Python has built-in functions like len(), max(), min().
Lists have built-in methods like .append(), .insert(), .remove(), .pop().
We can iterate over a list using for-in.
Now let's pull everything together one last time and build your bucket list!
