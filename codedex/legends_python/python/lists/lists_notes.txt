# Lists
Welcome to the Lists chapter! Thank you for sticking around. :)

Here, we'll learn about a neat way to store a bunch of data values. 📦 = ⚽️🏀⚾️🥎🏐🏈



Suppose we want to build a program that stores student grades for homework and quizzes, we would need to create a bunch of variables like so:

# Storing grades in a class

hw_grade1 = 98
hw_grade2 = 87
hw_grade3 = 92
hw_grade4 = 96

quiz_grade1 = 9
quiz_grade2 = 6
quiz_grade3 = 8

Creating a bunch of variables this way is tedious and error-prone. Can you imagine what it would be like with 100+ students?

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

We can rewrite the above code to:

# Storing grades in a class

hw_grades = [98, 87, 92, 96]
quiz_grades = [9, 6, 8]

The syntax for a list looks like:

list_name = [item1, item2, item3, item4]

Lists are created using square brackets [ and ]. And the items are separated by , commas.

# Examples
Data that could be stored in a list:

Temperatures in the past week.
pH level of the office plant in the past hour.
"Now playing" in the movie theater nearby.
temp = [86, 80, 82, 87, 79, 80, 82]
ph = [7.2, 7.1, 7.0, 7.0, 7.2, 7.1]
now_playing = ['Barbie', 'Oppenheimer', 'Talk to Me', 'Blue Beetle']

More facts about lists:

List items allow duplicate values.
Lists can have values with different data types.
There's no limit to how much data a list can hold.
