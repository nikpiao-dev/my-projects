# Built-in Functions
Python comes with some built-in functions, including ones specifically for lists.

Here are some examples:

The len() function returns the total length of a list.
The max() function returns the maximum value in a list.
The min() function returns the minimum value in a list.
Suppose we have two lists that look like:

stock1_prices = [2.52, 2.44, 2.32, 2.41, 2.51, 2.50, 2.44]
stock2_prices = [8.36, 8.31, 8.21, 8.21, 8.25, 8.11, 8.13]

print(len(stock1_prices))      # Output: 7
print(max(stock1_prices))      # Output: 2.52
print(min(stock2_prices))      # Output: 8.11

We can find a list's length, minimum, and maximum within a split second, even if the list has 1000+ items!

To learn more, here are all the Python built-in functions. However, not all built-in functions are designed to work with lists!
