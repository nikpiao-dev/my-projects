Instructions
When you go to a drive-thru like McDonald's, you can order food using the item numbers. For example, a Happy Meal might be a #3!

Create a drive_thru.py program with your favorite fast food chain's menu.

Define a get_item() function that takes in one parameter, the number of the item you want to order, and returns the name of that item!

For example, if you called the function with:

Argument value 1, it could return '🍔 Cheeseburger'.
Argument value 2, it could return '🍟 Fries'.
Argument value 3, it could return '🥤 Soda'.
Argument value 4, it could return '🍦 Ice Cream'.
Argument value 5, it could return '🍪 Cookie'.
Make sure to call this function a few times to make sure that it works!

Lastly, let's do the following:

Create a welcome menu and put that in a welcome() function.
Create a main program that takes in user input with input().
