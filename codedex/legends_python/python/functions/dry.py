Instructions
Create a dry.py program and check out the complete list of built-in functions:

Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.
Use each of these once in the program.

For the new function, try to read the documentation (😵‍💫) or Google it (👍)!

Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.

import random

list_of_foods = ['celery', 'broccoli', 'cabbage']

# This was the first function introduced in the course
print('Hello, World!')

# This function calculates the maximum of two numbers a and b
print(max(3, 5))

# This function calculates the minimum of two numbers a and b
print(min(-1, 7))

# This function calculates the length of a list
print(len(list_of_foods))

# This function calculates a to the power b
print(pow(2, 6))
