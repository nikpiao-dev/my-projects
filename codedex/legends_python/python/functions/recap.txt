# Congrats!
Congratulations! You now know how functions work. This is a concept that trips up a lot of people, so definitely practice and practice. ðŸ’ª

In this chapter, we learned:

The "Don't Repeat Yourself" methodology.
We've been using built-in functions like print() and input() all along.
How to define and call a function â€” the two-step process.
Inputs with parameters and arguments.
Outputs with the return keyword.
Function scope vs. global scope.
Here's the function skeleton one more time, just in case you forget!

def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
  # The code inside
  return value
