# Functions
As our code gets longer and longer, you might find yourself copying and pasting a particular code block in different parts of the program. That's no good!

‚ÄúDon't Repeat Yourself‚Äù (DRY) is a principle in software development aimed at reducing repetition and writing good clean code. Functions play a big part.



A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. To execute this block of code, you just need to write the function's name, followed by a pair of parenthesis ( ).

Whether the task is five or twenty lines of code, you can throw it in a function and use it later anywhere in your program. It takes a little more effort initially but will save you a lot of time in the long term.

Plot twist! In this course, we have been using functions all along. üß©

Built-in functions are 68 functions that come with the Python interpreter available for use. Here are some that you might recognize:

print()
input()
len()
We've used them before, but didn't get into how they work behind the scenes.

And that's okay! This is the beautiful part about built-in functions. Like a car, you don't need to know what's underneath the hood to operate it.

Let's look at some built-in Python functions!
