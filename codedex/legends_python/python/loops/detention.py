detention

Suppose you got detention and the teacher wants you to write "I will not use Snapchat in class" on the whiteboard 100 times.

Create a detention.py program that does this using code.

(This is where we begin to see the true power of computing. What takes humans hours can take a computer microseconds. ðŸ¤¯)
