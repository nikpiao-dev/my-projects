# range()
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use a for loop and the range() function.

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers. By default, the sequence starts at 0 and increments by 1, ending at a specified number.

for i in range(6):
  print(i)

For number i inside range(6), which is 0 through 5, print number i.

This will output:

0
1
2
3
4
5

Notice how this stops at 5, and 6 is not printed. This is because range() actually ends one before the specified number.
