Set Up Your Local Development Environment with Python
# Introduction
At Cod√©dex, we built an online code editor just for you. With no setup required, you can code to your heart‚Äôs desire. However, there is one minor issue: your code is in the cloud and requires the internet to run! Without Wi-Fi, you can no longer code. üò±

Well, there is a solution ‚Äì a local environment!

Running a program locally means using your computer's resources to execute a program. Therefore, a local environment is a simple setup to get your computer to run a program.

This article will cover how to install a code editor called VS Code and run Python on your own computer.

Let‚Äôs get started!



# Visual Studio Code
The code editor we recommend here at Cod√©dex is called Visual Studio Code.

Visual Studio Code, or VS Code for short, is a code editor created by Microsoft in 2015. It is now the editor of choice for professionals due to its ease of use and many features. We will highlight some of these features in a bit!

# Setting Up
## Download VS Code
First, download VS Code to your computer: https://code.visualstudio.com

Then, watch this quick 5-minute video about VS Code:


Follow the video at minute 2:20 to download the Python extension in VS Code.

And that's it for the VS Code installation!

For Windows users, there's a tiny bit more setup.
For Mac users, you can skip the next section.
## Install Python (Windows)
For Windows users, we need to install Python:

Go to python.org (Windows).
Look for a Python 3.XX.X release under Stable Releases that says "Windows installer (64-bit)" and click on the link.
Once it's downloaded, open the installer to install Python 3 on your Windows machine.
You are now ready for the journey ahead!

# Getting Familiar with VS Code

You‚Äôll see in your VS Code dashboard that you have access to many features specific to your dev environment!

On the left-hand side, inside the ‚ÄúEXPLORER‚Äù section, there's the structure of your folders and files.
The middle is where all your code goes.
On the bottom, you can see a command line, which is used to print outputs, access files, and more. You can use either a Windows command prompt or a Linux terminal!
# Hacks (Advanced)
Here are three Python VS Code hacks that you can start using right away!

## Hotkeys/Key Bindings
A key binding is a key, or a combination of keys, which causes something to happen when pressed. There are multiple key bindings you can use to streamline your dev environment. For example, you can paste the last line multiple times in a loop-like code, or add quotes to multiple strings at the same time! Some examples include shift+alt+‚Üì or ctrl + d!

Check the key bindings docs for more details!

## Debugging
While developing a program, programmers often run into bugs themselves. A software bug is an error that might cause a running program to behave unintendedly or even crash.

A common strategy to identify which section of the code is causing a bug, is to use print() statements. However, some bugs can‚Äôt be debugged using a single strategy.

Introducing the revolutionary technology of debuggers!

With VS Code debugging, you can quickly check your code for errors without writing a single line of extra code! We need to install the Python extension to enable debugging capabilities for Python code, which we‚Äôll look at in the next section.

## Extensions
VS Code has a lot of built-in plugins and extensions to make your coding streamlined and effortless. These extensions can help you format code, highlight syntax, debug, and even provide real-time documentation with auto-complete suggestions! Find more information here.

Some popular extensions include:

pylance
Jupyter
# Pip
The main feature that comes with installing Python is our package manager pip! Pip is used to download all external Python packages from Python Package Index called PyPI.

To download a package, go into your terminal and run:

pip install [package-name]

We will learn more about this in chapter 8.

# Conclusion
Now that you‚Äôve created your ideal development environment, go out there and explore ‚ÄúThe Legend of Python‚Äù with your new set up!
