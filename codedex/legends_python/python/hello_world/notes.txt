# Python
Welcome to the first chapter of The Legend of Python! üêç

The programming language we are learning is called Python, created by a developer named Guido van Rossum in the early 90s.



Python is designed to be easy for us to read, which makes it the perfect coding language for beginners.

It's also super versatile and used in the following areas:

Data analysis & visualization
Artificial intelligence (AI)
Machine learning (ML)
Web development
And more!
All the code we write in this course will be in Python files, with the .py extension. And we write them inside a code editor.

A code editor is a text editor where we can write and execute code.

There's a code editor on the right side, created just for you. üëâ

Let's give it a try!


# Comments
Comments are very important in programming because they are used to document what our code does. They are also used to disable parts of the program.

When the program is run, the comments are ignored.

In Python, we can create a comment using the # hashtag symbol:

# Printing out a message 
print('Hi')

On the first line, we created a comment. As a result, everything to the right of the hashtag # is ignored. The program continues to the next line, and the output is simply:

Hi

Python only ignores anything after the # on a line. So when a comment is placed towards the end of a line like this:

print('Hi')   # I'm a comment, too!

Here, the output will still be "Hi" because any code before the comment on the same line is still executed.
