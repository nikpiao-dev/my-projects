# Python
Welcome to the first chapter of The Legend of Python! 🐍

The programming language we are learning is called Python, created by a developer named Guido van Rossum in the early 90s.



Python is designed to be easy for us to read, which makes it the perfect coding language for beginners.

It's also super versatile and used in the following areas:

Data analysis & visualization
Artificial intelligence (AI)
Machine learning (ML)
Web development
And more!
All the code we write in this course will be in Python files, with the .py extension. And we write them inside a code editor.

A code editor is a text editor where we can write and execute code.

There's a code editor on the right side, created just for you. 👉

Let's give it a try!
