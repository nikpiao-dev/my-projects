Instructions
Let's use the datetime and random modules to make a birthday card to determine how far your birthday is from today! ðŸŽ‚

For this exercise, we are creating two .py files in a separate code editor.

Note: You can do this on VS Code! Check out this article to set up VS Code.

## bday_messages.py
Create a new file called bday_messages.py.

Import the random module.

Then, define a bday_messages list with the following items:

'Hope you have a very Happy Birthday! ðŸŽˆ',
'It's your special day â€“ get out there and celebrate! ðŸŽ‰',
'You were born and the world got better â€“ everybody wins! ðŸ¥³',
'Have lots of fun on your special day! ðŸŽ‚',
'Another year of you going around the sun! ðŸŒž'
Next, use the random.choice() method to get a single item from the list.

Save this item in a random_message variable.

Let's save bday_messages.py and move to the next part.

## main.py
Create a new file called main.py.

Import both the datetime module as well as bday_messages (the last file).

import datetime, bday_messages

Next, use the datetime module to create two date objects:

today: Today's date, using the datetime.date.today() method.
next_birthday: The date for your next birthday, using the year, month, and day arguments.
A really cool thing you can do with date objects is addition and subtraction!

time_difference = date1 - date2

Use date subtraction to calculate how many days away today is from next_birthday. Then, assign the result to a new variable called days_away.

Then, create a control flow statement:

If today is equal to next_birthday, print the random_message variable (imported from bday_messages).
Else, print 'My next birthday is {days_away} days away!'.
The output should look something like this:

My next birthday is 42 days away!

Bonus: Instead of using a date in the future, what if we tried to see how many days it's been since a past event, like the release date of your favorite movie or game, or the date you were born? What about how many years or months it's been?
