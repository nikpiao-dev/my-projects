Instructions
Remember when you wrote a letter to yourself called letter.py in the very first chapter? We are giving it back to you! ðŸ’Œ

It should appear in the code editor on the right. Do you recognize it? Take a moment and reflect on what you wrote yourself all those chapters ago!

And that's not all.

Open your terminal and type python3 to prompt it for Python code (or skip this step and do the following in our online editor).

Then, run the following code for some eternal words of wisdom:

"The Zen of Python" is a poem written by Tim Peters, a long-time Pythonista who wrote down Python's design style guide using 20 aphorisms. Only 19 are written down. Forty-two programs later, you can now decipher the wisdom:

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
...

The end is just the beginning!

This is where things get exciting, now that you have all the foundational building blocks. The world of programming just opened up in front of you officially.

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
