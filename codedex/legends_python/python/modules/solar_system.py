Instructions
Let's put our newfound knowledge of the from and as keywords to the test by finding out the surface areas of the planets in our solar system! ü™ê

Create a new file called solar_system.py.

Next, import the following at the top of the file:

From the math module, the pi (œÄ) variable.
From the random module, the .choice() method, renamed as ch for short.
Then, copy and paste the following list:

planets = [
  'Mercury',
  'Venus',
  'Earth',
  'Mars',
  'Saturn'
]

Next, use the ch() method to get a random string from planets and assign it to a variable called random_planet.

And use the imported pi (œÄ) variable to calculate the surface area of a sphere:


area=4œÄr 
2
 

To do this, we'll need to know the radius r for a given random_planet (rounded to the nearest kilometer).

Write an if/elif/else statement and assign a value to r with the following in mind:

If random_planet is 'Mercury', then r is 2440.
Else, if random_planet is 'Venus', then r is 6052.
Else, if random_planet is 'Earth', then r is 6371.
Else, if random_planet is 'Mars', then r is 3390.
Else, if random_planet is 'Saturn', then r is 58232.
Else, print "Oops! An error occurred." to the console.
Lastly, calculate the area and print the name of the random_planet along with its area to the console.

Bonus: The calculated results may seem a bit long. Is there a built-in Python function that can round it?
