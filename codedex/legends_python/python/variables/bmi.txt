# Exponents
Python can also perform exponentiation such as 2³ or 10².

In written math, we might see an exponent as a superscript number (like above), but typing superscripts isn't always easy on modern keyboards. Since exponentiation is super similar to multiplication, Python uses the notation **.

So 2 ** 3 is 2³ and 10 ** 2 is 10².

Here are more examples:

score = 2 ** 2      # score is 4
score = 2 ** 3      # score is now 8
score = 2 ** 4      # score is now 16
score = 2 ** 5      # score is now 32

print(score)        # Output: 32
