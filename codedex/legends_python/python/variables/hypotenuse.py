If you slept through your geometry class, a Pythagorean theorem is the relationship between the three sides of a right triangle. It was named after the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, born around 570 BC.

Pythagorean equation looks like:


c= 
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
â€‹
 

The a is the length of a short side.
The b is the length of another short side.
The c is the length of the hypotenuse.
The hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle.

Create a hypotenuse.py program that asks the user for two numbers, a and b, and then calculates the hypotenuse c.

Bonus: If you are looking for a harder challenge, try the Quadratic formula!

c = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
