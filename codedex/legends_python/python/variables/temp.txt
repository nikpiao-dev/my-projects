# Operators
Computers are incredible at doing math calculations. Now that we have learned about variables, let's use them with arithmetic operators to calculate things! ðŸ”¢

Python has the following arithmetic operators:

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulo (returns the remainder)
score = 0           # score is 0
score = 4 + 3       # score is now 7
score = 4 - 3       # score is now 1
score = 4 * 3       # score is now 12
score = 4 / 3       # score is now 1.3333
score = 4 % 3       # score is now 1

print(score)        # Output: 1

And take a look at this code that calculates a 20% tip by calculating the total and then multiplying by a float (decimal number):

pizza = 2.99
coke = 0.99

total = pizza + coke

tip = total * 0.2

print(tip) # Output: 0.796

Another way to write this is using parentheses to calculate the total and the tip in one line of code:

tip = (pizza + coke) * 0.2

In Python, parentheses have the highest order of operations.
