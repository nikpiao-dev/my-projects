# Congrats!
Nice! You've reached the end of another chapter! ðŸ¥³

Let's recap what we learned:

We learned how to:

Create a class and initialize it with certain attributes.
Create objects based on these classes and set values for these attributes.
Create classes using the special __init__() method.
Create instance methods that will update or use these class attributes.
Check out this Student class definition for a refresher:

class Student:
  def __init__(self, name, year, enrolled, gpa):
    self.name = name
    self.year = year
    self.enrolled = enrolled
    self.gpa = gpa

  def display_info(self):
    print('The student ' + self.name + '\'s GPA is ' + self.gpa + '!')

  def graduation(self):
    if self.enrolled and self.gpa > 2.5 and self.year == 12:
      print(self.name + ' will be able to graduate this year!')

In this final exercise, we will build a fun project using everything we've learned about classes and objects!

Let's get started!
