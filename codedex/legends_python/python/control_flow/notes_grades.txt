# If Statement
An if statement is used to test a condition for truth:

If the condition evaluates to True, code in the if part is executed.
If the condition evaluates to False, code is skipped.
if condition:
  # code inside

For example, if the grade variable is greater than 60:

if grade > 60:
  print('You passed!')

The code "inside" the if statement must be indented (preferably 2 spaces).

# Else
An else clause can be optionally added to an if statement.

If the condition evaluates to True, code in the if part is executed.
If the condition evaluates to False, code in the else part is executed.
if grade > 60:
  print('You passed.')
else:
  print('You failed.')

The code "inside" the else clause must also be indented
