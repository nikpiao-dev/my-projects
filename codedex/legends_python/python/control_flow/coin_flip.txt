Instructions
Before we dive deep into something called an if statement, let's do a fun demo using a coin flip simulation!

Create a coin_flip.py program and type in the following:

import random

num = random.randint(0, 1)   # Generates a random number that's either 0 or 1

if num > 0.5:
  print('Heads')
else:
  print('Tails')

Note: We will learn more about random and .randint() later in the chapter.

All you need to know is that this program simulates a coin toss:

â‰ˆ 50% of the time, it's "Heads".
â‰ˆ 50% of the time, it's "Tails".


Run the program 5 times to get a taste of the if/else statement!

How many times did it go Heads?
"""


import random

number = random.randint(0, 1)

count = 0

if number > 0.5:
  print("Heads")
  count += 1
  print("NUmber of times to get a head: ", count)
else:
  print("Tails")
