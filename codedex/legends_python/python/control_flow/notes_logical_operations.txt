# Logical Operators
One more thing that we should learn is logical operators.

Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions. They are and, or, and not operators:

and returns True if both conditions are True, and returns False otherwise.
or returns True if at least one of the conditions is True, and False otherwise.
not returns True if the condition is False, and vice versa.
Here are some examples:

if hunger > 4 and anger > 1:
  print('Hangry')

If the hunger variable is greater than 4 and the anger variable is greater than 1, then the program prints "Hangry".

if coffee > 0 or bubble_tea > 0:
  print('ðŸ˜Š')

If the coffee variable is greater than 0 or the bubble_tea variable is greater than 0, then the program prints a smiley face.

if not tired:
  print('Time to code!')

If the tired variable is not True, then the program prints "Time to code!"

So you might be wondering: and and or are awfully similar, how do I remember the differences between the two? Let's break this down in a table form:

A	B	A and B	A or B
False	False	False	False
False	True	False	True
True	False	False	True
True	True	True	True
