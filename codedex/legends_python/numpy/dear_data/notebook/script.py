Instructions
Ahh that new book smell... we got a fresh new notebook!

In the input box at the bottom, type:

print('So it\'s not gonna be easy. It\'s gonna be really hard.')

Press shift + enter to run the code. Did the output appear?

Next, type the same thing again. This time, press just enter.

It created a new line instead! Type this on the next line:

print('We\'re gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want all the data, forever. You and me.')

Press shift + enter to run the code block.
