# What is NumPy?
We live in a world full of data. Itâ€™s everywhere around us.

In fact, 328 million terabytes of data are created every day. To put that into perspective, if a byte is an inch, that would be 207,890,118,441 times around Earth... a day.

And within the bits & bytes, numbers & datasets, and tables & graphs, mysteries are waiting to be discovered and stories beckon to be told.

Welcome to the first chapter of Data Analysis: NumPy! ðŸ”¢



This is the beginning of our data science journey.

NumPy (short for "Numerical Python") is a Python library that supports large, multi-dimensional arrays. It also comes with a bunch of math functions that you can use to operate on these arrays.

It works well with other data science libraries such as Pandas (data analysis), Matplotlib (data visualization), and scikit-learn (machine learning), which makes NumPy the obvious first stop in the journey.

In this chapter, we will learn about the basics of NumPy.

# Notebook Documents
Before we get started, note that we will use something called a notebook to write and execute our code in this course.

A notebook is a file that contains a set of cells. Each cell can store and run code. Any output will be printed out right below the cell.

There are many flavors of this, Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab are the two popular ones used by academic and industry data analysts.
