# INSERT INTO
When you create a new table, it’s empty. Now, time to add some rows to it!

Use the INSERT statement to add a new row into a table:

INSERT INTO companies (id, name, headquarters, year)
VALUES (1, 'Twitter', 'San Francisco', 2006);

Let’s break this down:

INSERT INTO is a clause that adds the specified row.
companies the name of the table the row is being added to.
(id, name, headquarters, year) is a parameter with the column names that data will be inserted to.
VALUES clause indicates the data being inserted.
(1, 'Twitter', 'San Francisco', 2006) are the values.
After using this statement, there'll be be a new row in companies where:

id is 1
name is 'Twitter'
headquarters is 'San Francisco'
year is 2006
We can also add multiple rows like so:

INSERT INTO companies (id, name, headquarters, year)
VALUES (1, 'Twitter', 'San Francisco 🌁', 2006);

INSERT INTO companies (id, name, headquarters, year)
VALUES (2, 'Duolingo', 'Pittsburgh 🐝', 2011);

INSERT INTO companies (id, name, headquarters, year)
VALUES (3, 'BeReal', 'Paris 🇫🇷', 2020);

INSERT INTO companies (id, name, headquarters, year)
VALUES (4, 'Codedex', 'New York 🗽', 2022);

Here, we added four rows into the companies table.
