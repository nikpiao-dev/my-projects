Create Table
# Introduction
We’ve been retrieving data from SQL tables left and right, but where do SQL tables come from?

They don’t just fall from the sky. Someone has to create the tables for Data Analysts and Data Scientists to pull data from.

Today, that someone is you.

In this chapter, we will learn how to:

Create a new table.
Add new rows.
Add new columns.
Update an existing row.
Delete a row.
# CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE statement creates a brand new table in a database.

In the code editor, we are creating a new table called companies:

CREATE TABLE companies (
  id INTEGER,
  name TEXT,
  headquarters TEXT,
  year INTEGER
);

Here, we are creating a new table of companies with the following columns:

id column of the data type INTEGER.
name column of the data type TEXT.
headquarters column of the data type TEXT.
year column of the data type INTEGER.
We are essentially creating an empty table that looks like this:

id	name	headquarters	year
 	 	 	 
It’s empty because we haven’t added any data yet!

# Data Types
All the data stored in a database has a type. The data type lets the database know what to expect from each column and determines the kind of interactions that can happen.

Some of the most common data types are:

TEXT: a text string
INTEGER: a positive or negative whole number
REAL: a positive or negative decimal number
DATE: a date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
