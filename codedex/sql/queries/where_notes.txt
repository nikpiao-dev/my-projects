# WHERE
Now what if we wanted to filter information based on a condition? We can use the WHERE clause.

Where?

We can use the WHERE clause to filter for information based on a condition:

SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE id = 23;

id = 23 is the condition. Only shows with an id equal to 23 will be returned.

Here’s another example:

SELECT *
FROM shows
WHERE year > 2020;

year > 2020 is the condition. Only the shows that were released later than 2020 will be returned.

Note: The WHERE keyword always goes after the FROM part of the query.

# Comparison Operators
Here are all the SQL comparison operators that we can use in a condition:

= equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
We use them to compare two values in the WHERE clause.

Let’s try them out.
-- Combine conditions:
AND, OR, NOT

-- Examples:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25 AND location = 'USA';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE NOT status = 'cancelled';
