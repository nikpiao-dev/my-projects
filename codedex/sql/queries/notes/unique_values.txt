# Unique Values
When analyzing a database, we may want to view just the unique values within a column.

DISTINCT is used to return just the unique values in a column, so no duplicates.

Here's how we select all the genres from shows:

SELECT genre
FROM shows;

We'd get 50 rows of genres for each TV show with a bunch of duplicates.

If we add a DISTINCT keyword after SELECT:

SELECT DISTINCT genre
FROM shows;

Only the unique genres in the shows table will be returned.
