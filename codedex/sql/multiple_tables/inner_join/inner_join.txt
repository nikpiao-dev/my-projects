# INNER JOIN
It’s time to go over each of the joins! We will start off with the basic one: JOIN.

JOIN, or sometimes known as the INNER JOIN, selects rows that have matching values in two tables.

So instead of the usual:

SELECT columns
FROM table;

We can join table1 with table2 with JOIN:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2
  ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;

Or with INNER JOIN (the same thing):

SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
  ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;

We are selecting some columns from table1.
JOIN or INNER JOIN is how we are joining it with another table (table2).
ON a specific connection (table1.column1 = table2.column2).
One new thing here is the . dot operator. The table1.column1 just means table1’s column1.

Note: Joins are typically done between a primary key and a foreign key. So table1.column1 is likely a foreign key that references table2.column2, which is likely a primary key. But technically... SQL doesn't require the columns you're joining on to be foreign keys or primary keys. As long as the values match up, you can join them!

Suppose we have two tables. Here’s a directors table:

id	name	country	style
1	Quentin Tarantino	USA	Stylized violence, nonlinear, pop culture
2	Wes Anderson	USA	Symmetrical, vintage colors, quirky, indie
3	Greta Gerwig	USA	Coming-of-age, character-driven
4	Hayao Miyazaki	Japan	Animation, fantasy, nature, hand-drawn
5	Christopher Nolan	UK	High-concept, cerebral, epic
6	Bong Joon Ho	South Korea	Social commentary, dark comedy
7	Stanley Kubrick	USA	One-point perspective, long takes, details
8	Wong Kar-wai	China	Neon, dream-like, handheld camera, love
movies table:

id	name	year	director	genre	imdb
1	Pulp Fiction	1994	Quentin Tarantino	Crime, Drama	8.9
2	The Royal Tenenbaums	2001	Wes Anderson	Comedy, Drama	7.6
3	Fantastic Mr. Fox	2009	Wes Anderson	Animation, Comedy	7.9
4	Barbie	2023	Greta Gerwig	Comedy, Fantasy	6.8
5	Lady Bird	2017	Greta Gerwig	Comedy, Indie	7.4
6	Spirited Away	2001	Hayao Miyazaki	Animation, Fantasy	8.6
7	Howl’s Moving Castle	2004	Hayao Miyazaki	Animation, Fantasy	8.2
8	Parasite	2019	Bong Joon Ho	Drama, Thriller	8.5
9	Anora	2024	Sean Baker	Comedy, Drama	7.5
If we want to join directors with movies:

SELECT name, year, country
FROM directors
INNER JOIN movies
  ON directors.name = movies.director;

Here, we are joining the two tables on the directors.

Note: Nothing technically happens to the two tables when we join them. We are just looking at the results to find insights; the database doesn’t actually change.
