# LEFT JOIN
So we just learned the regular JOIN / INNER JOIN, but what if we want to combine two tables and keep some of the un-matched rows?

A LEFT JOIN, also known as the LEFT OUTER JOIN, will keep all rows from the left table, plus matched rows in the right table.

Here’s the pseudo code:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
  ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;

So in our last example with directors table and movies table, it would be:

SELECT name, year, country
FROM directors
INNER JOIN movies
  ON directors.name = movies.director;

So what’s the difference between JOIN and LEFT JOIN?

JOIN:

Returns rows where there’s a match in both tables.
If there’s no match, that row is excluded.
LEFT JOIN:

Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right.
If there’s no match on the right, you’ll still get the left row... but with NULLs for the right-side columns.
No worries if it's confusing at first! This is something you can always Google later.
