Joins
# Introduction
Welcome to the last chapter of the SQL course! You made it.

So far in the course, we have only dealt with one table at a time. But in the real world, data isnâ€™t stored in a single table.

Imagine you are a Data Analyst at Spotify. Thereâ€™s a table for artists, one for albums, one for songs, one for users, and one for playlists.

Now someone on the team wants to know: Which users have added songs by Taylor Swift to their playlists?

The answer lies in the connections across multiple tables. Thatâ€™s where SQL joins come in.

multiple tables

A join lets us combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column.

There are several types of joins in SQL, each serving a different purpose:

JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
FULL JOIN
UNION

In this chapter, we will learn how to work with multiple tables by joining them!

Letâ€™s get started. ðŸ‘¯
