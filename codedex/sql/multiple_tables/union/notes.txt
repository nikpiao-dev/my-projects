# UNION
Now that we learned joins, thereâ€™s another simple way to combine tables: UNION.

The UNION operator in SQL combines two tables into one list, without duplicates.

SELECT columns
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT columns
FROM table2;

Suppose we go back to the movies and directors database and we do:

SELECT name
FROM directors
UNION
SELECT name
FROM movies;

The results would be:

name
Quentin Tarantino
Wes Anderson
Greta Gerwig
Hayao Miyazaki
Christopher Nolan
Bong Joon Ho
Stanley Kubrick
Wong Kar-wai
Sean Baker
Let's try this out.
