-- The GROUP BY statement groups rows of data with the same values into buckets. Itâ€™s often used with aggregate functions to group the result by one or more columns.

SELECT genre, COUNT(*) 
FROM playlist 
GROUP BY genre;



-- Suppose we want to see the average song lengths for each genre, we can do:
SELECT genre, AVG(duration)
FROM playlist 
GROUP BY genre;




-- Using GROUP BY, find all the different artists and their average number of plays in two columns.


SELECT * 
FROM playlist;

SELECT artist, AVG(plays)
FROM playlist
GROUP BY artist;
