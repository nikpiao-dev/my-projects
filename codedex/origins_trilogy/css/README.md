# Personal Website Project üåê

Welcome to my final project for the Codedex CSS course! üéâ

This project will showcase everything I‚Äôve learned in HTML and CSS while building my personal website. It‚Äôs an invaluable tool for self-expression and an essential part of any web developer‚Äôs portfolio.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content of the site.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file where all the styling for the site is defined.
- `images`: This folder contains all the icons and the profile picture used on the site.

## Sections of the Website

### 1. **About Me**
   - A brief introduction about myself.
   - Includes a profile picture and a short bio.
   - Includes social media icons linking to LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub (sample profile only).

### 2. **Projects**
   - Displays a list of your sample projects.
   - Each project has a title, description, and a link to the live project (sample only).

### 3. **Contact**
   - Inlcudes year and short custom message
   - Provides contact details such as email and phone.
   
## Style with CSS

The website is styled using CSS, which includes:

- **Selectors** to target elements and apply styles.
- Properties like **color**, **font**, **text alignment**, and **background**.
- Modifications to the **box model**, including **width/height**, **padding**, **margin**, and **border**.
- **Positioning** of elements on the page to create a clean and organized layout.
