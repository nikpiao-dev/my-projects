Project: Mini Interactive Story Game
Instructions:
Setup the UI:

A main text area or paragraph where the story text appears.

Below it, 2 or 3 buttons representing choices the user can click.

A “Restart” button to reset the story.

Functionality:

The story starts with an opening scene (a short paragraph).

Based on the user’s choice (clicking one of the buttons), the story branches to different paragraphs.

Each scene has its own text and choices, creating a branching narrative.

When a scene has no further choices, show an ending message and the option to restart.

JavaScript Logic:

Represent the story as an object or array where each scene has:

A text paragraph.

An array of choices (each choice has text and points to the next scene).

Clicking a choice updates the main text and buttons for the next scene.

The Restart button resets the story to the beginning.

Bonus:

Keep track of user choices and show a summary at the end.

Add some styling changes based on the story mood (e.g., background color changes per scene).

Animate transitions between scenes (fade in/out).
