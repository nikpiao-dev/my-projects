# 🌟 JavaScript Horoscope & Fortune Project

Hi! I created this project as part of my JavaScript learning journey. It’s a fun little app that randomly generates a **horoscope** and a **fortune** message based on the birth month.

## 💡 Features

- Randomly selects a **birth month** (1–12).
- Assigns a **zodiac sign** and a personalized horoscope message.
- Generates one of six **fortune messages** (even for uplifting, odd for humorous).

## 🔮 Horoscope Logic

The app maps each month to a zodiac sign and a unique horoscope. The messages are themed and loosely inspired by zodiac traits with a seasonal twist.

## 🍪 Fortune Generator

The program includes six fortunes:
- **Even fortunes** (2, 4, 6): Uplifting or motivational.
- **Odd fortunes** (1, 3, 5): Humorous or quirky.

Each time you run the program, it prints:
- Your randomly selected birth month.
- A zodiac sign and horoscope.
- A fortune message.
