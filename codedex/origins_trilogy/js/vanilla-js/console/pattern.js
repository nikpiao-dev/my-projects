Instructions
Suppose we want the output to look exactly like this pattern below:

   a
  b c
 d e f
g h i j
   k

How can you do that?

Create a JavaScript program that prints this pattern exactly as shown.

This will likely take some trial and error, but give it a shot!

"""


console.log("   a  ");
console.log("  b c ");
console.log(" d e f ");
console.log("g h i j");
console.log("   k  ");
