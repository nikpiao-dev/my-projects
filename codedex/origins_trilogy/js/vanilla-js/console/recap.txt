# Congrats!
We've made it to the end of the first chapter! ðŸŽˆ

console.log("Congrats! You've made it.");

To recap what we've learned:

The console.log() method outputs messages to the Console window.
JavaScript code runs one line at a time, from top to bottom.
Single line comments are created using the // forward slashes.
Multi-line comments are started by /* and closed with */.
It's time to use what we've learned to build something fun!
