02. The Console
# The Web Console
Hold up, what the heck is a web console?

A web console is a feature in your browser that can run JavaScript code.

It's usually located in the browser's Developer Tools:

Google Chrome logo
Google Chrome: Click View > Developer > JavaScript Console.

Safari logo
Safari: Click Develop > Show JavaScript Console.

Mozilla Firefox logo
Mozilla Firefox: Click Tools > Browser Tools > Web Developer Tools.

It should look something like:

Console window for JavaScript

For now, we're going to use the editor and Console window that we created just for your learning experience. 👉🏼

# Console Log
In JavaScript, the console.log() method tells the web console to output a message. We are going to use this a lot.

The message we want to display should be inside parentheses ( ) and surrounded by quotes. They can be double quotes " or single quotes ', but the opening and closing quote marks have to match.

This is an example of a console.log() method:

console.log("👋 Howdy!");
console.log('👋 Howdy!');

In the code above, we instructed our program to print, or log, a message. The message can either be in double or single quotes.

The resulting text that is displayed is referred to as the output.

The output of the message would be:

👋 Howdy!
👋 Howdy!

Note: It's optional to include a ; semicolon at the end of a line in JavaScript.
