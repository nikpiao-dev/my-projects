Instructions
The year is 2099... we can now take a vacation on the moon or Mars! ðŸš€



Create a weight conversion program that:

Takes your weight on Earth.
Converts it to your weight on either the moon or Mars.
To calculate your weight on Mars:


destination_weight=earth_weightÃ—0.38

The output of the program should look like this:

Your weight on Earth is 210 pounds.
Your weight on Mars is 79.8 pounds.

"""



let earth_w = 230;

let mars_w = earth_w * 0.38;


console.log("Your weight on Earth is", earth_w, "pounds.");
console.log("Your weight on Earth is", mars_w, "pounds.");
