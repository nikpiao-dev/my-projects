# Operators
Computers are incredible at doing math calculations. Now that we know about variables, let's use them with arithmetic operators to perform math calculations.

JavaScript has the following arithmetic operators:

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulo (returns the remainder)
** Exponent (covered in the next exercise)
We use these operators to write expressions:

let score = 0;        // Declare score and initialize it

score = 4 + 3;        // score is now 7
score = 4 - 3;        // score is now 1
score = 4 * 3;        // score is now 12
score = 4 / 3;        // score is now 1.3333
score = 4 % 3;        // score is now 1

console.log(score);   // Output: 1

The following code calculates a 20% tip by adding the total price of a pizza and coke, and then multiplying by a decimal number (also known as a float):

const pizza = 2.99;
const coke = 0.99;

let total = pizza + coke;

let tip = total * 0.2;

console.log(tip);     // Output: 0.796

Another way to write this in one line of code is with parentheses:

let tip = (pizza + coke) * 0.2;

In JavaScript, anything in parentheses is evaluated first. Therefore, the values of pizza and coke are added together before the total is multipled by 0.2.
