06. Let & Const
# Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used for storing data values that can be used later in the program. Each variable has a name and they hold a value. ðŸ“¦



To create or declare a variable, we need a let or const keyword:

let is used for variables where the value will change.
const is used for variables where the value will stay constant.
After the keyword, we need a variable name, an = sign, and a value:

keyword name = value;

Here are some examples of variable declarations:

const userId = "1618033988";
let userName = "Leeroy Jenkins";

You may have noticed that variable names like userName are written in camelCase, where the first word is all lowercase and the first letter of all other words are capitalized. This convention is used for variable names made of more than one word.

The = equal sign means assignment. We are:

Assigning the value "1618033988" to the const variable userId.
Assigning the value "Leeroy Jenkins" to the let variable userName.
For a let variable, we can change its value, or print it out:

let userName = "Leeroy Jenkins";
userName = "Leeroy05";

console.log(userName);  // Output: Leeroy05

Here, we assign "Leeroy Jenkins" to the userName variable. Then, we reassign it with a new value, "Leeroy05", and then print it out.

For a const variable, we can't change its value, but we can still print it:

const userId = "16180339887";

console.log(userId);    // Output: 16180339887

If you try to reassign a new value to a const variable (or create one without a value), you get an error like this one:

const userId = "1680339887"
const userId = "8675309"

// Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'userId' has already been declared
