07. Data Types
# Data Types
While there are many types of data in JavaScript, let's start with four of them.

## Number
A number can be any integer or decimal number. It can be used to represent whole numbers, fractions or precise measurements.

let year = 2023;
let age = 28;
let mealCost = 12.99;
const pi = 3.14;
const daysOfWeek = 7;

## String
A string is used for storing text or sequence of characters. Strings are wrapped in double quotes " " or single quotes ' '.

let message = "good nite";
let user = '@zuck';
const company = "Cod√©dex";

## Boolean
A Boolean data type, or bool, stores a value that can only be either true or false. In JavaScript, it's lowercased true or false.

let hungry = true;
let lateToMeeting = false;
const earthIsFlat = false;

## Undefined
Any variable that is declared but hasn't yet received a value is undefined. This may happen when a variable is declared without being assigned a value, or when it is explicitly assigned a value of undefined:

let startDate = "01/23/2022";
let endDate;

console.log(startDate);  // 01/23/2022
console.log(endDate);    // undefined

This data type is useful if you create a variable but haven't yet decided what value it should have.
