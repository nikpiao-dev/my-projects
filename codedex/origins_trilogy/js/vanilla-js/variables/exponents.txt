# Exponents
JavaScript can also perform exponentiation such as 2³ or 10².

In written math, we might see an exponent as a superscript number (like above), but typing superscript numbers isn't always easy on modern keyboards. In JavaScript, we use the ** notation for exponententiation.

let score = 0;

score = 2 ** 2;      // score is 4
score = 2 ** 3;      // score is now 8
score = 2 ** 4;      // score is now 16
score = 2 ** 5;      // score is now 32

console.log(score);  // Output: 32

Note: In the order of operations, exponents are calculated before multiplication/division and addition/subtraction.
