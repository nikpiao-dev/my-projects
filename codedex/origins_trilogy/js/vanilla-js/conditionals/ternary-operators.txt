Ternary Operators
# Getting Started
When writing a simple conditional statement in JavaScript, it usually features the if and else keywords:

if (condition) {
  // Run if true
} else {
  // Run if false
}

However, this would be a great opportunity to use a ternary operator!

A ternary operator is used as a shorthand for an if/else statement. Instead of writing an if/else statement across multiple lines, you can do the same thing on a single line!

condition ? ifTrue : ifFalse;

The ternary operator uses a ? question mark operator that evaluates a condition on its left side and either runs the code represented by ifTrue (on one side of the : colon) or runs code in the ifFalse section (on the other side).

It's amazing to think that all of this is going on in a single statement on one line!

The value of of ifTrue and ifFalse can be either of the following:

Raw data, like numbers, strings, etc.
A defined variable with a value.
A function that returns a value, like console.log().
Note: The resulting value of a ternary operation can be saved to a variable!

Let's revisit the code from the Coin Flip exercise:

let num = Math.random();

if (num > 0.5) {
  console.log("Heads");
} else {
  console.log("Tails");
}

How would we work the if/else statement above into a single line with the ternary operator?
