# Control Flow
Every JavaScript program we've worked with thus far executes one line at a time, from top to bottom. Each time we run the program, the same result is logged to the Console window.

But what if we want our program to do different things based on different conditions?

This can be done with control flow statements!

It's as if you are going down a road and there's a fork ahead with a sign that reads “Albuquerque: left. Phoenix: right.”

In the “Conditionals” chapter, we will explore how programs “make decisions” by evaluating different conditions and introduce logic into our code!
