# if statement
The conditional we used in the last exercise began with the if keyword, which tests a condition for truth and executes the code if it is true:

Here's a simple form of the if statement:

if (condition) {
  // Do something
}

If the condition is true, then the statements within are executed. If the condition is false, then nothing happens and the program continues on after the if statement.

For example:

if (grade > 60) {
  console.log("You passed!");
}

The if keyword is followed by a condition, grade > 60, inside a set of parentheses ( ).

If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces { } executes.
If the condition is false, the code inside the curly braces is skipped.
Now that we understand more about the console and outputting messages, let's try it again!
