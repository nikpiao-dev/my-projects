# Math.random()
Remember the Coin Flip program in the beginning of the chapter? Let's learn how we can use a random number generator to add some more fun to our program.

In JavaScript, the Math.random() method returns a random decimal number between 0 and 1.

Suppose we print out three of them, like so:

console.log(Math.random());
console.log(Math.random());
console.log(Math.random());

The output would have three different numbers and that look something like:

0.0236966238022709
0.7397680104909345
0.4103022944399179

We will learn more about what a method and what Math.random() means in a later chapter.

To get a random integer between 0 to 9:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);

This is multiplying the decimal number by 10 and then rounding it down to the nearest integer with Math.floor().

So the above three numbers would look like:

0
7
4
