# Congrats!
console.log("Congrats! You've made it. ðŸŽ‰")

Here's a recap of everything we learned so far:

Conditionals control the order in which the program's code executes.
if statement checks a condition for truth and executes the code if it is.
else executes the code if none of the above is True.
One or more else ifs can be added between if and else.
Comparison operators compare two values: ===, !==, >, >=, <, <=.
Logical operators combine two or more conditions: &&, ||, !.
Here's an if/else if/else statement in action just in case:

if (review > 4.5) {
  console.log("Extraordinary");
} else if (review >= 4) {
  console.log("Excellent");
} else if (review >= 3) {
  console.log("Good");
} else {
  console.log("Eh");
}

It's time to use what we've learned to build something awesome!
