Instructions
Before we dive into how conditional statements are made in the next exercise, let's do a demo using a coin flip!

Create a coin.js program and type in the following:

let num = Math.random();

if (num > 0.5) {
  console.log("Heads");
} else {
  console.log("Tails");
}

Note: We will learn about Math.random() later in the chapter.

All you need to know is that this program simulates a coin toss:

≈ 50% of the time, it's "Heads".
≈ 50% of the time, it's "Tails".
Run the program 5 times to get a taste of the conditionals!

How many times did we get Heads? How many for Tails?
