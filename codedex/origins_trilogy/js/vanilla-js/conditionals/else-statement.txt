# else if
Now you might be wondering, if/else just gives us two options, but how do we have more than two?

You can add an else if section between the if and else in your control flow! This gives your program more conditions to evaluate, besides just two.

if (conditionA) {
  // Do this
} else if (conditionB) {
  // Do this, instead
} else {
  // Do this if none of the above are true
}

You don't have to add just one else if; you can include as many as you want!

For example, we could apply this to a school grading system:

let grade = 93;

if (grade > 90) {
  console.log("A");
} else if (grade > 80) {
  console.log("B");
} else if (grade > 70) {
  console.log("C");
} else if (grade > 60) {
  console.log("D");
} else {
  console.log("F");
}

Like the if statement, the code in an else if statement runs if its condition is true and the code in the rest of the if/else if/else statement is skipped.

Here, because the grade is 93, the output would be "A".
