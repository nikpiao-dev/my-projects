# else Clause
An else clause can be optionally added to the end of an if statement.

if (condition) {
  // Do something
} else {
  // Do something else 
}

If the condition is true, execute the code inside the if.
Else the condition is false, execute the code inside the else.
Here's an if/else statement in action:

if (grade > 60) {
  console.log("You passed.");
} else {
  console.log("You failed.");
}

If grade > 60 is true, then the program prints “You passed.”
Else, the program prints “You failed.”
# Comparison Operators
Usually, we are comparing two values in a condition. To do so, we use comparison operators:

=== strict equal
!== strict not equal
> greater than
>= greater than or equal
< less than
<= less than or equal
We've used < and > already, these are just more kinds of comparisons that we can make.
