# Logical Operators
One more thing that we should learn is logical operators.

As your if/else if/else statements get bigger and more complex, so do the conditionals!

We already learned to evaluate conditions with comparison operators like > and <. But we can go further and combine conditions with logical operators.

Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions. They are &&, ||, and ! operators:

The AND logical operator && returns true if both conditions are true, and returns false otherwise.
The OR logical operator || returns true if at least one of the conditions is true, and false otherwise.
The NOT logical operator ! returns true if the condition is false, and vice versa.
Here are some examples:

if (hunger > 4 && anger > 1) {
  console.log("Hangry");
}

If the hunger variable is greater than 4 and the anger variable is greater than 1, then the program prints "Hangry".

if (coffee > 0 || bubble_tea > 0) {
  console.log("ðŸ˜Š");
}

If the coffee variable is greater than 0 or the bubble_tea variable is greater than 0, then the program prints a smiley face.

if (!tired) {
  console.log("Let's code!");
}

If the tired variable is not true, then the program prints "Let's code!"

So you might be wondering: && and || are awfully similar, how do I remember the differences between the two?

A	B	A && B	A || B
false	false	false	false
false	true	false	true
true	false	false	true
true	true	true	true
