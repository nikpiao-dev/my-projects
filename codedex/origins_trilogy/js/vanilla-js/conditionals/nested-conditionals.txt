Nested If Statements
# Syntax
Sometimes, asking "what if?" can lead to more "what if"s. In JavaScript, and programming in general, this is no different.

Conditional statements use the if and else keywords to tell the computer the steps to take in a program based on certain conditions.

if (time > 10) {
  console.log("Let's start coding! 🧑‍💻");
} else {
  console.log("Make sure to get good sleep 😴");
}

However, you can also nest your if statements!

A nested if statement is an if statement inside another if statement:

if (time > 10) {
  if (coffee == true) {
    console.log("Let's start coding! 🧑‍💻");
  } else {
    console.log("Time to brew some fresh coffee. ☕️!");
  }
} else {
   console.log("Make sure to get good sleep! 😴");
}

The logic works like this:

nested if statements

Any code inside of an if statement that evaluates to true will run, including more conditional statements!

# Example
The following example illustrates how nested if statements can affect the output of a program:

let weather = "Sunny";
let temperature = 85;

if (weather == "Sunny") {
  if (temperature > 80) {
    console.log("Yay, let's go to the beach! 🏖️");
  } else {
    console.log("Let's do something fun outdoors! ⛰️");
  }
} else {
  console.log("Let's watch some shows on the couch! 🍿");
}

This will output the following to the console:

Yay, let's go to the beach! 🏖️

If the temperature is 75 degrees, the output would be:

Let's do something fun outdoors! ⛰️

But if the the weather isn't "Sunny":

Let's watch some shows on the couch! 🍿
