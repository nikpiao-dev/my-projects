Instructions
Let's use our newfound knowledge of JavaScript loops to create a program that converts an integer into its equivalent binary number.

Note: Binary numbers are "base-2", meaning that they are represented by 0s and 1s.

In a based-numbers.js file, create a program that starts with a myNumber variable, initialized to an integer of your choosing, followed by a binary variable set to an empty string.

Next, use a loop to go from myNumber down to 0, reducing myNumber by half each time using Math.floor(myNumber / 2).

In each iteration of the loop:

Determine the remainder of dividing myNumber by 2 using the % operator.
If the remainder is 0, the next binary digit is "0".
If the remainder is 1, the next binary digit is "1".
Prepend this digit to the binary string (i.e., add it to the beginning of the string).
Then, update myNumber by dividing it by 2 and rounding down with Math.floor().

When the loop ends, the binary string will contain the correct binary representation of the original number.
