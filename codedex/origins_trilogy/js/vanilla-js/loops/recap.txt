Woohoo! We made it to the end of the chapter!

Here is a recap of what we learned:

You can use loops to perform the same operations over and over.
A while loop runs as long as a condition is true.
A for loop runs a certain amount of times, based on an iterator variable.
The continue keyword ends the current iteration in a loop, given a true condition.
The break keyword exits the loop entirely, given a true condition.
