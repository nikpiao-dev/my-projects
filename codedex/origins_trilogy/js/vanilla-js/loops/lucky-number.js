Instructions
Let's use a while loop to see what your lucky number could be!

In a lucky-number.js file, define a luckyNumber and set it to your favorite number. Next, create a guess variable that is between 1 and 10, using the Math.floor() and Math.random() methods:

const luckyNumber = 7
let guess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;

Next, create a while loop that runs as long as the guess and the luckyNumber are not equal. Each time, print the incorrect number and then print the luckyNumber outside the loop.

The output should look like the following:

Nope, it isn't  5
Nope, it isn't  9
Nope, it isn't  4
My lucky number is 10!
