# while Loops
In the last exercise, we got a demo of the while loop. Let's explore this more!

The while loop uses a condition that is either true or false.

while (condition) {
  // Code here
}

As long as the condition is true, the code in the while loop will run. Otherwise, the loop ends when the condition becomes false.

The logic is quite similar to how we used if statements. The difference is that instead of executing once if a condition is true, the while loop executes it again and again while that condition is true.
