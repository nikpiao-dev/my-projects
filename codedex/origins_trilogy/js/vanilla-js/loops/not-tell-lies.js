Instructions
Suppose you got detention and the professor asks you to write a phrase 100 times.

Let's create a program that uses for loops to make short work of this!

Use the for loop to log the following message to the Console 100 times:

I Must Not Tell Lies

(This is where we begin to see the true power of computing. What takes humans hours can take computer microseconds. ðŸ¤¯)

"""

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  console.log(`${i}: I Must Not Tell Lies`);
}
