# for...of
ES6 also gave us a new way to do repetitive things. First is the for...of loop.

This loop is great for iterating over each item in a sequence such as a string:

const name = "dumbo";

for (let letter of name) {
  console.log(letter);
}

/* Output:
d
u
m
b
o
*/

You can also do this for an array:

const boroughs = ["brooklyn", "manhattan", "the bronx", "queens", "staten island"];

for (let borough of boroughs) {
  console.log(borough);
}

/*
Output:
brooklyn
manhattan
the bronx
queens
staten island
*/

# for...in
Another fun loop to check out is the for...in.

This is ideal for looping through objects. More specifically, you're looping through the object's keys:

const person = {
  name: "Austin",
  age: 29,
  occupation: "musician"
}

for (let info in person) {
  console.log(person[info]);
}

/*
Output:
Austin
29
musician
*/

As you loop through each key in the person object, you access the paired value with [ ] bracket notation (i.e., person[info]).
