On Spotify, the top 5 most streamed songs have over 18 billion listens combined! ðŸ¤¯

On line 29, let's use for...of and for...in loops to display info about these songs on the console.

The output should look like this:

Blinding Lights
The Weeknd
4260000000

Shape of You
Ed Sheeran
3901000000

Someone You Loved
Lewis Capaldi
3413000000
