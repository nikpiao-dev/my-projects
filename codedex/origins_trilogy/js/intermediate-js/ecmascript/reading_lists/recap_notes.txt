Over the years, how we write JS code has become more robust. Here's a refresher on the things we've learned:

ES6 modernized a lot of how we write JS today.
Arrow functions offer a concise way of writing functions, even on one line!
We can use template literals to write single strings with placeholder variables.
The for...of and for...in loops are good with arrays and objects, respectively.
Spread operators simplify adding array items or object properties into new arrays or objects in JavaScript.
Rest operators are placeholders for arrays that might have zero or more items.
